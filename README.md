# FeedX

This solution allows advertisers to run experiments on their shopping feed.
It implements a range of A/B testing best practices to improve the power and 
robustness of the results. 

It includes the functionality to perform a power analysis to design an optimal 
experiment based on historical data, and then to analyse the results of the 
experiment based on the experiment data. 

This will be applicable for testing any treatment that is applied to the
shopping feed, for example title, description or price optimisation.
